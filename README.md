# Omok-Multiplayer-Game

Omok (오목), also known as five in a row, is a traditional game played in Korea and in many parts of Asia.

This is a project to build a web application on which people can play Omok with other players and keep track of their scores.

The project will be built using:
- Python along with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite for backend.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with [Skeleton CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) for frontend.
